you pressed the button to open the gate.
This isn't the first time you've done this,
so you know how to time it exactly.
Just as the door close, you slide right into the HQ
You know you did the right thing, the government 
would have just torn the car apart.
They don't know its secrets....
that is holds the key to different worlds.
As you step out of the vehicle, Fido runs up to you
"Thank you for saving me," he says.
it makes a strange sound.
It changed its form.
You've seen it before, but only on TV.
"...Bumblebee???"
"Ruin has come to our family...."
