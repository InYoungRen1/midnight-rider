 WELCOME TO MIDNIGHT RIDER
 
 WE'VE STOLEN A RELIC. WE NEED TO GET IT HOME.
 THE RELIC IS SPECIAL.
 
 THE CORP WANTS IT FOR THEIR GAIN.
 
 WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
 
 ONE GOAL: SURVIVAL... and THE RELIC.
 REACH THE END BEFORE THE AGENTS GET YOU.

    A. Eat a dumpling

you pressed the button to open the gate.
This isn't the first time you've done this,
so you know how to time it exactly.
Just as the door close, you slide right into the HQ
You know you did the right thing, the corp 
would have just torn the relic apart.
They don't know its secrets....
that is holds the key to different worlds.
As you step out of the vehicle, Johnny SilverHand runs up to you
"Thank you for saving me," he says.
it makes a strange sound.
It changed its form.
You've seen it before, but only on TV.
"...Geralt???"
"Ruin has come to our family...."
